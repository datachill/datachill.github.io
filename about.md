Hi, Dechao here. I am currently a data scientist at [MSD Singapore](http://www.msd-singapore.com/home/), known as [Merck](http://www.merck.com/index.html) in the US and Canada. My interests are in learning and applying latest deep learning algorithms, building data products, and big data.

### More Information

I am also a dog lover, and I have a jack russell terrier, whose name is Yuki, meaning snow in Japanese.
