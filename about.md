Hi, Dechao here. I am a data scientist based in Singapore. My interests are in learning and applying latest deep learning algorithms, building data products, and big data.

Currently I am working for [MSD Singapore](http://www.msd-singapore.com/home/), which is known as [Merck](http://www.merck.com/index.html) in north America. 

### More Information

I am also a dog lover, and I have a jack russell terrier, whose name is Yuki, meaning snow in Japanese.
