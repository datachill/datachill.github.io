## DataChill

[**DataChill**](https://dechaochensg.github.io/) is a personal blog of [Chen Dechao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dechaochen/), a data scientist based in Singapore.

### The Name

Why the blog is called DataChill, while my name is actually Dechao? Well, although Dechao is the sound of my name 德超 in Mandarin, the same Chinese characters actually sound more like Tak Chiu in my mother tongue Cantonese. Now the name makes sense huh?

### The topics

This blog is mainly about sharing non-work-related data science / machine learning / deep learning projects that I did or am working on. Hopefully I can make it interesting and helpful at the same time.
